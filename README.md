# Tetherbots PyBullet Simulation

This repository holds the PyBullet simulation framework for realistically simulating the control algorithm and physical behavior of coordinated tether-connected robots that have minimal access to global sensing information beyond the strain and orientation of its connected tether(s).

## Agent Class

The Agent class implemented in agent.py represents the structure and capabilities of a tetherbot, and an agent object represents a singular tetherbot instantiation.
